## Roll v3.5 — a dark preview now says what it knew

**Three reports say the preview went dark and the camera restarted, and none of them says anything
a fix could start from.** [light-reports#233], [#293] and [#309], against v3.1, v3.3 and v3.4 — one
of them from somebody who is not the author. The watchdog is working exactly as designed in all
three: it notices the capture stamps have stopped, rebinds, tells the user, and files a fault so a
camera that heals itself is still a camera whose disease gets reported.

The trouble is what the fault carries. One sentence, and the sentence is already known.

**Everything that would narrow it down was in hand and thrown away one line later.** How long the
stamps had been still, what counted as too long at that moment, whether the zero-shutter-lag ring
was still in play, which flash mode the session was holding, whether the exposure was manual — the
watchdog reads all of it to make its decision and then keeps none of it. The report now carries the
lot, along with the mode, the filter, zone focus, and how many captures were in flight.

This matters because the last explanation is spent. The finalize race — the muxer flush stalling the
repeating request so every recording ended in a false death verdict — was the cause of the earlier
dark previews and it is fixed. Whatever is behind #233, #293 and #309 is something else, and there
is nothing in "Preview went dark. Camera restarted." to find it with.

**The title is fixed too.** A fault is headed "Could not <what>", and this one passed a sentence
where a verb phrase belongs, so three issues arrived titled *"Could not Preview went dark. Camera
restarted"*. It now reads "Could not keep the preview alive", and the three-strikes fault beside it
"Could not keep the camera alive — three restarts inside a minute".

Nothing about when the watchdog fires has changed. This release only makes the next one of these
worth reading.

Addresses [light-reports#233], [#293] and [#309] — instrumentation, not a fix. They stay open until
a report on this build says what the numbers are.
