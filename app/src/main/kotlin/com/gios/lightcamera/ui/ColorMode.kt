/**
 * Lifts LightOS's forced greyscale while the camera is looking at something.
 *
 * The Light Phone III's panel is a **full-colour AMOLED**. Its black-and-white look is
 * Android's accessibility colour correction — the daltonizer — pinned to monochromacy, which
 * is a secure setting and a SurfaceFlinger colour-matrix change, so switching
 * `accessibility_display_daltonizer_enabled` off shows true colour instantly with no restart.
 * LightOS does the same thing itself: photos and video play in colour on a phone that is
 * otherwise grey.
 *
 * A camera is the strongest case there is for it. Half the filters here are about colour —
 * Thermal is a false-colour ramp, Dither 16 is a sixteen-colour palette — and a viewfinder
 * that shows you a grey version of the photograph it is about to save in colour is lying about
 * the picture.
 *
 * Writing the setting needs `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS`, which is
 * `signature|privileged|**development**` and so grantable over adb exactly once:
 *
 * ```
 * adb shell pm grant com.gios.lightcamera android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS
 * ```
 *
 * Without the grant every call here quietly does nothing — the `SecurityException` is
 * swallowed — and the viewfinder stays grey like the rest of the phone. It degrades rather
 * than breaks, which is why colour is on by default.
 *
 * Ported from LightChat's `ColorMode`, deliberately as a straight port: the reference counting
 * and the foreground handling below are load-bearing and were arrived at the hard way.
